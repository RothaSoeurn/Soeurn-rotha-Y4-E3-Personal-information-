            <p class="fs-2">Banteay Srei</p>
            <p class="fs-5">Considered by many to be the jewel in the crown of Angkorian art, Banteay Srei is cut from
                stone of a pinkish hue and includes some of the finest stone carving anywhere on earth. Begun in 967 CE,
                it is one of the smallest sites at Angkor, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in stature. The art
                gallery of Angkor, this Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva is wonderfully well preserved, and many of its
                carvings are three-dimensional.</p>

            <p>
                Banteay Srei means ‘Citadel of the Women’, and it is said that it must have been built
                by a woman, as the elaborate carvings are supposedly too fine for the hand of a man.


            </p>
            <p>Banteay Srei is one of the few temples around Angkor to be commissioned not by a king but
                by a Brahman, who may have been a tutor to Jayavarman V. The temple is square and has
                entrances at the east and west, with the east approached by a causeway. Of interest are
                the lavishly decorated libraries and the three central towers, which are decorated with
                male and female divinities and beautiful filigree relief work.</p>
            <p>Classic carvings at Banteay Srei include delicate women with lotus flowers in hand and
                traditional skirts clearly visible, as well as breathtaking recreations of scenes from
                the epic Ramayana adorning the library pediments (carved inlays above a lintel).
                However, the sum of the parts is no greater than the whole – almost every inch of these
                interior buildings is covered in decoration. Standing watch over such perfect creations
                are the mythical guardians, all of which are copies of originals stored in the National
                Museum.</p>
            <p>Banteay Srei was the first major temple restoration undertaken by the EFEO in 1930 using
                the anastylosis method. The project, as evidenced today, was a major success and soon
                led to other larger projects such as the restoration of Bayon. Banteay Srei is also the
                first to have been given a full makeover in terms of facilities, with a large car park,
                a designated dining and shopping area, clear visitor information and a state-of-the-art
                exhibition on the history of the temple and its restoration. There is also a small baray
                behind the temple where local boat trips (US$7 per boat) are possible through the lotus
                pond.</p>

            <p>
                When Banteay Srei was first rediscovered, it was assumed to be from the 13th or 14th centuries, as it
                was thought that the refined carving must have come at the end of the Angkor period. It was later dated
                to AD 967, from inscriptions found at the site.


            </p>

            <p>
                Banteay Srei is about 32km northeast of Siem Reap and 21km northeast of Bayon. It is well signposted and
                the road is surfaced all the way, so a trip from Siem Reap should take about 45 minutes by car or one
                hour by remork. Moto and remork drivers will want a bit of extra cash to come out here, so agree on a
                sum first. You can eat at one of several small restaurants, complete with ornate wood furnishings cut
                from Cambodia’s forests, near the entrance to the temple.
            </p>


            <p>
                There's plenty to do in Banteay Srei District as well as several homestays should you wish to stay and
                explore the area. It is possible to combine a visit to Banteay Srei as part of a long day trip to the
                River of a Thousand Lingas at Kbal Spean and Beng Mealea. A half-day itinerary might include Banteay
                Srei, the Cambodia Landmine Museum and Banteay Samre. It takes 45 minutes to explore Banteay Srei
                temple, but allow 1½ hours to visit the information centre and explore the area.
